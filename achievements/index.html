      <h2>How do I get started?</h2>
      <h5>Finding/Forming a Party</h5>

      <ul>
        <li>Every objective but Sticking it to the Manta and Shrimp Smorgasbord is best attempted with a premade, full
          8-person party of Lv. 80 - 90 fishers for Indigo achievements, and Lv. 90 fishers for Ruby achievements.
          Parties are sometimes made for the solo/individual achievements as well for spectral current control, but are
          not required, and if you do make/join one for it you do not need it to be a full party.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>All objectives can and have been completed in parties of less than 8 people. Jelled Together and Maritime
            Dragonslayers are the ones easiest to successfuly complete with smaller parties.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Before the time for registration on your target route begins, set up or search for a party under the
          Gathering Forays section of the Party Finder. Parties often start forming 15 - 30 minutes before registration
          begins.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>It is a good idea, especially if you are the party leader, to ensure that everyone who joins the party is
          aware of what the objective is before queueing.</li>
        <li>Mikah Tayuun (no relation) has <a
            href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/27182703/blog/4721961/">made macros covering each
            objective</a> that can be used to quickly and simply share stop-by-stop information with your party that can
          be posted in the party chat beforehand and/or at the beginning of each stop.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Queueing Up</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Registration ends 15 minutes past the hour when it opens. Your party can queue as late as 14m59s past the
          hour with one non-standard Duty Finder language option selected to increase the odds that you are not paired
          with other fishers outside your party.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>If playing on an NA or JA data centre, D or F are the best options. If playing on an EU data centre, J is
            the best option.</li>
          <li>This is not required but provides for greater control over spectral currents, allowing you to avoid
            undesired ones and to get the desired ones (if they proc) extended to 3 minutes from the normal spectral
            current length of 2 minutes.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>To change your Duty Finder language settings: open the Duty Finder and click the cogwheel in the top left.
          The Duty Finder Settings window will open. Select one non-English language at the bottom and hit Confirm. Only
          the party leader needs to do this.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Queueing late (10+ minutes past when registration opens) with limited Duty Finder language settings is the
          most likely way to get a solo/party only boat, but it is not guaranteed. If other players queued with the same
          options selected as you/your party, you will get paired with them.</li>
        <ul>
          <li> <i>If your party is paired with other players,</i> it's advised that you inform them of your party's
            objective if you are attempting to control spectral currents. The best thing you can do when paired with
            random players is to state your goal and politely ask them to go along with it.
            Keep in mind that random players you are queued with have no obligation to work with your party. Players may
            attempt to get a small/solo boat in order to focus ★★★★★ fish or just out of preference and might have goals
            that conflict with yours. If they do not help or proc a current you do not want, this is not a reportable
            offence or something that ruins an objective.
            Spectral current extensions were added in patch 5.4 and the jellyfish, seadragon, shark, and octopus
            objectives have existed since patch 5.2. These objectives were all possible without extensions, and so are
            any of the others.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>If you do this, don't forget to return your Duty Finder language settings back to what they normally are
          afterwards.</li>
      </ul>
